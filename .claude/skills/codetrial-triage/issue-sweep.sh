# Read-only snapshot of the open issues for the triage sweep. Writes nothing to
# GitHub; SKILL.md says what each list asks of the maintainer and what it does
# not prove.
#
# Usage: issue-sweep.sh [repo] [wait-days] (default sysprog21/codetrial, 7)
#
# Prints one JSON object:
#   maintainers_known  false when the collaborators listing failed, leaving
#               only comment badges to tell a maintainer; a COLLABORATOR badge
#               also marks read-only collaborators, so the listing decides
#               whenever it is available
#   unanswered  issues no maintainer other than the author has commented on,
#               oldest first, so a collaborator's own follow-up is not an answer;
#               the viewer's own issues and a deleted account's are left out,
#               since nobody else answers the first and nobody can the second;
#               closing_prs lists open PRs whose merge closes the issue, which
#               makes it the PR sweep's once the PR is read (waiting.md)
#   waiting     issues whose newest maintainer comment is newer than anything
#               the reporter did since, comment or body edit; overdue once it
#               is older than wait-days. Issues a maintainer opened are left
#               out; claimed marks a reporter who also holds the issue, and
#               closing_prs is as in unanswered
#   linked      issues a pull request cross-referenced after the issue opened,
#               split into merged and still open; a PR from another
#               repository is left out, since its number means nothing here
#   lint        mechanical gaps per issue: empty_body, placeholder (template
#               text left in), empty_section, title_prefix, not_english (more
#               CJK than Latin letters; other scripts are not detected), and
#               no_revision on a Bug with no hex revision from the reporter;
#               a bare hash must mix digits and letters so a date or a word
#               does not pass, and a pasted --version line always does
#   claimed     per assignee who is not a maintainer: their open_prs and
#               merged_prs that cross-referenced the issue, idle_days since
#               their last act or a later maintainer comment (checked_at),
#               stale past wait-days with no such PR, asked_last when theirs
#               is the newest comment; stale is null when the history is cut,
#               and idle_days too when none of their acts is in what was read
#   truncated   issues with more than 100 comments or cross-references, 10
#               assignees, 20 assignments, 20 body edits or 10 closing PRs,
#               whose lists above may miss what was cut
