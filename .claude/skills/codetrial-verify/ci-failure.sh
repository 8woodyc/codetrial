# Read-only diagnosis of a pull request's failing checks: which failed on the
# current head, which gates scripts/test.sh named in its last line, the error
# lines around them, and whether the same job also fails on main, so a stale
# run, a regression the branch brought and a failure main shares are told apart
# before anyone is asked to fix anything. Writes nothing.
#
# Usage: ci-failure.sh <pr> [repo] (repo defaults to sysprog21/codetrial)
#
# Prints one JSON object:
#   pr, head    the PR and its current head commit
#   pending     checks still running; held: checks awaiting approval, which
#               have no log yet
#   failing     each failed, cancelled or timed-out check: name, run and job
#               ids, current (its run is on the head), gates (from "failed
#               gates:"), errors (the lines of its job log that mark a
#               failure), excerpt (the last lines before the gate summary),
#               on_main (the job of that name also failed in the latest
#               finished check run on main), or, for a check outside GitHub
#               Actions, its link only. current and on_main are null when the
#               lookup behind them failed, and gates, errors and excerpt when
#               the job log could not be read.
#   stale_base  true when every failing lane failed only gates that read
#               outside data (the table in the last jq below: cargo-audit
#               reads the advisory database), on the current head, main's
#               latest run started after those runs and succeeded in each of
#               those lanes, nothing is pending or held, no check outside
#               Actions fails, and the PR changes none of the files those gates
#               read: main has since moved past the data, and a rebase is the
#               whole answer. False otherwise, including when a lookup failed.
#               This is the one definition; the docs point here.
