# The formatter chain lives in scripts/indent.sh, because the gate has to run
# the same tools over the same files in the same order; two copies of that list
# would agree only until one of them was edited. Clippy stays here: it is a
# lint rather than a formatter, and `make check` runs it too.

# The same chain against a copy of the tree, so nothing is rewritten. Unlike the
# gate, a formatter the tree needs and lacks fails here rather than skipping.

# No verify-vendor prerequisite: scripts/test.sh runs it, and having both hash
# 12MB of wasm twice per check bought nothing.

# Mutation testing, deliberately outside `make check`: one mutant is a rebuild
# and a full `cargo test`, which is five minutes here, so a whole-tree pass is
# measured in days rather than minutes. It is a periodic audit, run at the
# points where "the tests pass" needs to mean something stronger.
#
# MUTANTS_SCOPE is the default because a scope is the whole decision. The only
# mutation run this tree ever kept covered the agent and LiveKit half and left
# the accounts, delivery and retention half unmutated -- the half where a
# surviving mutant is a way a candidate's recording outlives the promise made
# about it. That is what this scope names, and it is where a run should start
# when nobody has said otherwise. Override it for anything else:
#
#     make mutants MUTANTS_SCOPE='-f src/web/token.rs'
#
# The output lands in mutants.out/, which is gitignored: it is a report about
# one revision on one machine, and the last one to sit in a working tree went
# five days and nine commits stale, naming line numbers that no longer existed.
# Regenerate it rather than reading an old one.
#
# `--timeout` is absolute and generous on purpose. cargo-mutants otherwise
# derives one from how long the baseline took, and the baseline runs alone
# while every mutant after it runs alongside `-j` siblings: a suite that took
# eleven seconds by itself takes minutes under eight of them, so a derived
# timeout marks live mutants TIMEOUT. A timeout is neither caught nor missed,
# so that reads as a clean run while measuring nothing.
#
# Kept out of MUTANTS_SCOPE for exactly that reason. Bundled in with the file
# filters, the override above silently dropped the timeout with the scope it
# meant to replace, and the run it produced is the one this paragraph describes:
# clean-looking and measuring nothing.

# `--cargo-arg=--locked` rather than a bare `--locked`: cargo-mutants owns its
# own flags and forwards this one to every cargo it runs, which is what keeps a
# mutant from being judged against a lockfile it quietly updated.

# The hooks run the fast half of the gate over the staged content and hold the
