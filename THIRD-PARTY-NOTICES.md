CodeTrial redistributes the following browser assets. Verify their

The MediaPipe binaries, the Pyodide binaries, pdf.js and Tree-sitter are fetched at build time from
the version or commit named in their `FETCH` manifests, and accepted only when
they match the adjacent `SHA256SUMS`. The LiveKit client and the three-vrm
bundle are committed and pinned in place.

License texts and source details are shipped with the relevant assets:

- `web/vendor/LICENSE-apache-2.0.txt` (LiveKit client, MediaPipe, pdf.js)
- `web/vendor/tree-sitter/LICENSE` (browser runtime and five grammars)
- `web/vendor/avatar/LICENSE-three.txt`
- `web/vendor/avatar/LICENSE-three-vrm.txt`
- `web/vendor/avatar/NOTICE`
- `web/vendor/avatar/README.md`
- `web/vendor/pyodide/README.md`
- `web/vendor/pdfjs/README.md`

The build also patches two Rust crates, kept in source form with their licenses:

- `vendor/livekit-net/` ([livekit-net](https://crates.io/crates/livekit-net)
  0.1.4, Apache-2.0), LiveKit's network transport, moved to tokio-tungstenite
  0.30 for patched certificate roots and given bundled roots on its proxied
  path; its `README.md` and `LICENSE` say what changed
- `vendor/tokio-tungstenite/` ([tokio-tungstenite](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-tungstenite)
  0.30.0, MIT), moved to webpki-roots 1.0.10; its `README.md` and `LICENSE`
  say what changed

The executable compiles in Mozilla's root certificates from
[webpki-roots](https://crates.io/crates/webpki-roots) 1.0.10, under
the [Community Data License Agreement - Permissive 2.0](https://cdla.dev/permissive-2-0/).

Compiler Explorer is a remote service, not bundled software. C, C++, and Java
source is sent to it only when remote test runs are enabled.
